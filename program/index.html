    <strong>Wilt Thou Be My Dearie</strong>
    <em>Robert Burns, 1794</em>
  </h3>

  <pre>
Wilt thou be my Dearie?
When Sorrow wring thy gentle heart,
O wilt thou let me cheer thee!
By the treasure of my soul,
That's the love I bear thee:
I swear and vow that only thou
Shall ever be my Dearie!
Only thou, I swear and vow,
Shall ever be my Dearie!

Lassie, say thou lo'es me;
Or, if thou wilt na be my ain,
O say na thou'lt refuse me!
If it winna, canna be,
Thou for thine may choose me,
Let me, lassie, quickly die,
Still trusting that thou lo'es me!
Lassie, let me quickly die,
Still trusting that thou lo'es me!

    <strong>The Fall of the Leaf</strong>
    <em>Robert Burns</em>
  </h3>
  <pre>
The lazy mist hangs from the brow of the hill,
Concealing the course of the dark-winding rill;
How languid the scenes, late so sprightly, appear!
As Autumn to Winter resigns the pale year.

The forests are leafless, the meadows are brown,
And all the gay foppery of summer is flown:
Apart let me wander, apart let me muse,
How quick Time is flying, how keen Fate pursues!

How long I have liv'd-but how much liv'd in vain,
How little of life's scanty span may remain,
What aspects old Time in his progress has worn,
What ties cruel Fate, in my bosom has torn.

How foolish, or worse, till our summit is gain'd!
And downward, how weaken'd, how darken'd, how pain'd!
Life is not worth having with all it can give-
For something beyond it poor man sure must live.

    <strong>The Braes of Yarrow</strong>

    <em>Rev. John Logan</em>
  </h3>
  <pre>
Thy braes were bonny, Yarrow stream!
When first on them I met my lover;
Thy braes how dreary, Yarrow stream!
When now thy waves his body cover!
For ever now, O Yarrow stream!
Thou art to me a stream of sorrow;
For never on thy banks shall I
Behold my love, the flower of Yarrow.

“He promised me a milk-white steed,
To bear me to his father’s bowers;
He promised me a little page,
To ‘squire me to his father’s towers;
He promised me a wedding-ring,—
The wedding-day was fix’d to-morrow;—
Now he is wedded to his grave,
Alas, his watery grave, in Yarrow!

“His mother from the window look’d,
With all the longing of a mother;
His little sister weeping walk’d
The green-wood path to meet her brother:
They sought him east, they sought him west,
They sought him all the forest thorough,
They only saw the cloud of night,
They only heard the roar of Yarrow:

“No longer from thy window look,
Thou hast no son, thou tender mother!
No longer walk, thou lovely maid!
Alas, thou has no more a brother!
No longer seek him east or west,
And search no more the forest thorough,
For, wandering in the night so dark,
He fell a lifeless corse in Yarrow.

“The tear shall never leave my cheek,
No other youth shall be my marrow;
I’ll seek thy body in the sream,
And then with thee I’ll sleep in Yarrow.”
The tear did never leave her cheek,
No other youth became her marrow;
She found his body in the stream,
And now with him she sleeps in Yarrow.

    <strong>Ode written in a visit to the country in Autumn</strong>

    <em>Rev. John Logan</em>
  </h3>
  <pre>
‘Tis past! no more the Summer blooms!
Ascending in the rear,
Behold congenial Autumn comes,
The Sabbath of the year!
The pensive evening shade beneath,
And twilight consecrates the floods;
While Nature strips her garment gay,
And wears the vesture of decay,
O let me wander thro’ the sounding woods!

Ah! Well-known streams! Ah! Wonted groves,
Still pictured in my mind!
Oh! Sacred scene of youthful loves,
Whose image lives behind!
While sad I ponder on the past,
The joys that must no longer last;
The wild-flower strown on Summer’s bier,
The dying music of the grove,
And the last elegies of love,
Dissolve the soul, and draw the tender tear!

Alas! The hospitable hall,
Where youth and friendship play’d,
Wide to the winds a ruin’d wall
Projects a death-like shade!
The charm is vanish’d from the vales;
No voice with virgin-whisper hails
A stranger to his native bowers:
No more Acadian mountains bloom,
Nor Enna valleys breath perfume,
The fancied Eden fades with all its flowers!

Companions of the youthful scene,
Endear’d from earliest days!
With whom I sported on the green,
Or roved the woodland maze!
Long-exiled from your native clime,
Or by the thunder-stroke of Time
Snatch’d to the shadows of Despair;
I hear your voices in the wind,
Your forms in every walk I find,
I stretch my arms: ye vanish into air!

My steps, when innocent and young,
These fairy paths pursued;
And, wandering o’er the wild, I sung
My fancies to the wood.
I mourn’d the linnet-lover’s fate,
Or turtle from her murder’d mate,
Condemn’d the widow’d hours to wail:
Or while the mournful vision rose,
I sought to weep for imaged woes,
Nor real life believed a tragic tale!

Alas! Misfortune’s cloud unkind
May Summer soon o’ercast;
And cruel Fate’s untimely wind
All human beauty blast!
The wrath of Nature smites our bowers,
The hopes of life in embrio sweeps;
Pale o’er the ruins of his prime,
And desolate before his time,
In silence sad the mourner walks and weeps!

Relentless power! Whose fated stroke
O’er wretched man prevails!
Ha! Love’s eternal chain is broke,
And friendship’s covenant fails!
Upbraiding forms! A moment’s ease—
O Memory! How shall I appease
The bleeding shade, the unlaid ghost?
What charm can bind the gushing eye?
What voice console th’incessant sigh,
And everlasting longings for the lost?

Yet not unwelcome waves the wood,
That hides me in its gloom,
While lost in melancholy mood
I muse upon the tomb.
Their chequer’d leaves the branches shed;
Whirling in eddies o’er my head,
They sadly sigh, that Winter’s near:
The warning voice I hear behind,
That shakes the wood without a wind,
And solemn sounds the death-bell of the year.

Nor will I court Lethean streams,
The sorrowing sense to sleep;
Nor drink oblivion of the themes
On which I love to weep.
Belated oft by fabled rill,
While nightly o’er the hallowed hill
Aerial music seems to mourn;
I’ll listen Autumn’s closing strain;
Then woo the walks of youth again,
And pour my sorrows o’er th’untimely urn!

    <strong>Let Christian Faith and Hope Dispel</strong>
    <em>Paraphrase of Romans 8:31-end, Scottish Metrical Psalter</em>
  </h3>
  <pre>
Let Christian faith and hope dispel
The fears of guilt and woe;
The Lord Almighty is our friend
And who can prove a foe?

He who his Son, most dear and lov’d,
Gave up for us to die,
Shall he not all things freely give
That goodness can supply?

Behold the best, the greatest gift,
Of everlasting love!
Behold the pledge of peace below,
And perfect bliss above!

Where is the judge who can condemn,
Since God hath justify’d?
Who shall charge those with guilt or crime
For whom the Saviour dy’d?

The Saviour dy’d, but rose again
Triumphant from the grave;
And pleads our cause at God’s right hand,
Omnipotent to save.

Who then can e’er divide us more
From Jesus and his love,
Or break the sacred chain that binds
The earth to heav’n above?

Let troubles rise, and terrors frown,
And days of darkness fall;
Through him all dangers we’ll defy,
And more than conquer all.

Nor death nor life, nor earth nor hell,
Nor times destroying sway,
Can e’er efface us from his heart,
Or make his love decay.

Each future period then will bless,
As it has bless’d the past;
He lov’d us from the first of time,
He loves us to the last.
  </pre>
