          <b>Tim Macdonald &amp; Jeremy Ward</b> are a touring Scottish fiddle
          duo who combine traditional fiddling with hisÂ­torical scholarship to
          create a musical experience that has been described as everything from
          "cutting-edge" and "metal" to "classic" and "baroque". Using period
          instruments and mixing High Baroque chamber music with high-energy
          dance tunes, their music is at times soulful and at time electrifying,
          but always moving.
