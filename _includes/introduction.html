          Tim Macdonald &amp; Jeremy Ward are a touring Scottish fiddle duo who
          combine traditional fiddling with historical scholarship to create a
          “cutting edge” musical experience that has been described as anything
          from “metal” to “baroque.” Using period instruments and mixing High
          Baroque chamber music with high-energy dance tunes, their
          18th-century Scottish aesthetic brings a fresh perspective to the
          tradition.
