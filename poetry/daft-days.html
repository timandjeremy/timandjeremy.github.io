<h2 class="text-center">The Daft Days</h2>

Now mirk December’s dowie face
Glowers owre the rigs wi sour grimace,
While, through his <em>minimum</em> o space,
<span class="indent">The bleer-eed sun,</span>
Wi blinkin light and stealin pace,
<span class="indent">His race doth run.</span>

Frae naked groves nae birdie sings;
To shepherd’s pipe nae hillock rings;
The breeze nae odorous flavour brings
<span class="indent">Frae Borean cave;</span>
And dwynin Nature droops her wings,
<span class="indent">Wi visage grave.</span>

Mankind but scanty pleasure glean
Frae snawy hill or barren plain,
When winter, midst his nippin train,
<span class="indent">Wi frozen spear,</span>
Sends drift owre a his bleak domain,
<span class="indent">And guides the weir.</span>

Auld Reekie! thou art the canty hole,
A bield for mony a cauldrife soul,
Wha snugly at thine ingle loll,
<span class="indent">Baith warm an couth;</span>
While round they gar the bicker roll,
<span class="indent">To weet their mouth.</span>

When merry Yule-day comes, Ah trow,
You’ll scantlins find a hungry mou;
Sma are our cares, our stamacks fu
<span class="indent">O gusty gear,</span>
And kickshaws, strangers to our view,
<span class="indent">Sin fernyear.</span>

Ye browster wives! Now busk ye braw,
And fling your sorrows far awa;
Then, come and gie’s the tither blaw,
<span class="indent">O reaming ale,</span>
Mair precious than the well o Spa,
<span class="indent">Our hearts to heal.</span>

Then, though at odds wi aa the warl,
Amang oursels we’ll never quarrel;
Though discord gie a cankard snarl,
<span class="indent">To spoil our glee,</span>
As lang’s there’s pith into the barrel,
<span class="indent">We’ll drink and gree.</span>

Fiddlers! Your pins in temper fix,
And rozet weel your fiddlesticks,
But banish vile Italian tricks
<span class="indent">Frae out your quorum;</span>
Nor fortes wi pianos mix –
<span class="indent">Gie’s Tullochgorum!</span>

For nought can cheer the heart sae weel,
As can a canty Highland reel;
It even vivifies the heel
<span class="indent">To skip and dance:</span>
Lifeless is he wha canna feel
<span class="indent">Its influence.</span>

Let mirth abound: let social cheer
Invest the dawnin o the year;
Let blithesome innocence appear,
<span class="indent">To crown our joy;</span>
Nor envy, wi sarcastic sneer,
<span class="indent">Our bliss destroy.</span>

Now mark December’s dreary face
Glowering over the farmland with sour grimace,
While, through his minimum of space,
<span class="indent">The bleary-eyed sun,</span>
With kindly-looking light and furtive pace,
<span class="indent">His race does run.</span>

From naked groves no bird sings;
To shepherd’s pipe no hillock rings;
The breeze no odorous flavor brings
<span class="indent">From Borean [northern] cave;</span>
And Nature, pining away, droops her wings,
<span class="indent">With visage grave.</span>

Mankind but scanty pleasure glean
From snowy hill or barren plain,
When winter, ‘midst his nipping train,
<span class="indent">With frozen spear,</span>
Sends drift over all his bleak domain,
<span class="indent">And guides the war.</span>

Edinburgh! You are the lively and pleasant hole,
A shelter for many a coldly indifferent soul,
Who rests snugly by the fire,
<span class="indent">Both warm an friendly;</span>
While they tip up the beer mug,
<span class="indent">To wet their mouths.</span>

When merry Yule-day comes, I believe
You’ll hardly find a hungry mouth;
Small are our cares, our stomachs full
<span class="indent">Of tasty things,</span>
And little treats, strangers to our view,
<span class="indent">Since last year.</span>

You brewer’s wives! Prepare things well,
And fling your sorrows far away;
Then, come and give us the other pull,
<span class="indent">Of frothy ale,</span>
More precious than the well of Spa,
<span class="indent">Our hearts to heal.</span>

Then, though at odds with all the world,
Among ourselves we’ll never quarrel;
Though discord gives an ill-natured snarl,
<span class="indent">To spoil our glee,</span>
As long as there’s any strength to the barrel’s contents,
<span class="indent">We’ll drink and come to terms.</span>

Fiddlers! Fix your pegs in tune,
And rosin well your fiddlesticks,
But banish vile Italian tricks
<span class="indent">From your friend-group;</span>
Nor fortes with pianos mix –
<span class="indent">Give us Tullochgorum!</span>

For naught can cheer the heart so well,
As can a cheerful Highland reel;
It even vivifies the heel
<span class="indent">To skip and dance:</span>
Lifeless is he who cannot feel
<span class="indent">Its influence.</span>

Let mirth abound: let social cheer
Invest the dawning of the year;
Let blithesome innocence appear,
<span class="indent">To crown our joy;</span>
Nor envy, with sarcastic sneer,
<span class="indent">Our bliss destroy</span>
