    <strong>The Fall of the Leaf</strong>
    <em>Robert Burns</em>
  </h3>
  <pre>
The lazy mist hangs from the brow of the hill,
Concealing the course of the dark-winding rill;
How languid the scenes, late so sprightly, appear!
As Autumn to Winter resigns the pale year.

The forests are leafless, the meadows are brown,
And all the gay foppery of summer is flown:
Apart let me wander, apart let me muse,
How quick Time is flying, how keen Fate pursues!

How long I have liv'd-but how much liv'd in vain,
How little of life's scanty span may remain,
What aspects old Time in his progress has worn,
What ties cruel Fate, in my bosom has torn.

How foolish, or worse, till our summit is gain'd!
And downward, how weaken'd, how darken'd, how pain'd!
Life is not worth having with all it can give-
For something beyond it poor man sure must live.

    <strong>The Braes of Yarrow</strong>

    <em>Rev. John Logan</em>
  </h3>
  <pre>
Thy braes were bonny, Yarrow stream!
When first on them I met my lover;
Thy braes how dreary, Yarrow stream!
When now thy waves his body cover!
For ever now, O Yarrow stream!
Thou art to me a stream of sorrow;
For never on thy banks shall I
Behold my love, the flower of Yarrow.

“He promised me a milk-white steed,
To bear me to his father’s bowers;
He promised me a little page,
To ‘squire me to his father’s towers;
He promised me a wedding-ring,—
The wedding-day was fix’d to-morrow;—
Now he is wedded to his grave,
Alas, his watery grave, in Yarrow!

“His mother from the window look’d,
With all the longing of a mother;
His little sister weeping walk’d
The green-wood path to meet her brother:
They sought him east, they sought him west,
They sought him all the forest thorough,
They only saw the cloud of night,
They only heard the roar of Yarrow:

“No longer from thy window look,
Thou hast no son, thou tender mother!
No longer walk, thou lovely maid!
Alas, thou has no more a brother!
No longer seek him east or west,
And search no more the forest thorough,
For, wandering in the night so dark,
He fell a lifeless corse in Yarrow.

“The tear shall never leave my cheek,
No other youth shall be my marrow;
I’ll seek thy body in the sream,
And then with thee I’ll sleep in Yarrow.”
The tear did never leave her cheek,
No other youth became her marrow;
She found his body in the stream,
And now with him she sleeps in Yarrow.

    <strong>Paraphrase of Chap. III of the Book of Job (excerpt)</strong>

    <em>Robert Fergusson</em>
  </h3>
  <pre>
Say, wherefore has an over-bounteous Heaven
Light to the comfortless and wretched given?
Why should the troubled and oppress'd in sould
Fret over restless life's unsettled bowl,
Who long for death, who lists not to their prayer,
And dig as for the treasures hid afar;
Who with excess of joy are blest and glad,
Rejoic'd when in the tomb of silence laid?
Why, then, is grateful light bestow'd on man,
Whose life is darkness, all his days a span?
For ere the morn return'd, my sighing came,
My mourning pour'd out as the mountain stream;
Wild-visag'd fear, with sorrow-mingled eye,
And wan destruction, hideous, star'd me nigh!
For though no rest nor safety blest my soul,
New trouble came, new darkness, new countroul.
  </pre>
