  To you their tidings true I bring,

  This day, to you, is born a child

  Of Mary meek and Virgin mild.

  That blessed babe, gracious and kind,

  Shall bring you joy, both heart and mind.

  It is the Lord, Christ, God and Man,

  He will do for you what he can:

  Your Savior he himself will be,

  From sin and Hell to make you free.

  He is your true salvation,

  From everlasting damnation:

  That you may reign in glory and bliss,

  For ever more in heaven with us.

  So humble, in a crib lying:

  In this way lies your Creator,

  Who out of nothing made the world.

  Let us be glad and full of joy,

  And with the flock go straight away,

  And see what God of his grace has done,

  Through Christ to bring us to his throne.

  How have you now become so poor,

  That you would lie on hay and straw,

  Among the asses, oxen and cows?

  But ever more will I praise Thee,

  Unto Thy glory, sing sweetly:

  And in my heart will bow the knee,

  And sing that fitting lullaby.

  The angels take much joy to hear,

  The gracious gift of this New Year."
